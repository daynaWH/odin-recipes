            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Biscotti, known also as cantucci, are Italian almond biscuits that originated in the Tuscan city of Prato. They are twice-baked, oblong-shaped, dry, crunchy, and may be dipped in a drink, traditionally Vin Santo.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
                <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
                <li>3 eggs</li>
                <li>3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets or line with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Beat together sugar, oil, and eggs in a medium bowl until well-blended. Combine flour and baking powder in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture to form a heavy dough.</li>
                <li>Divide dough into two equal pieces. Form each piece into a log the length of a cookie sheet. Place one log on each of the prepared sheets; and press dough down to 1/2-inch thickness.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer logs to wire racks; let sit until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes.</li>
                <li>Slice each log crosswise into about eighteen 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place slices cut-sides up back on the cookie sheets.</li>
                <li>Bake until lightly toasted and golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes per side.</li>
            </ol>
